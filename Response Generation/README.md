Technologies Used:
* Python Standard Libraries: json, os, sys
* AWS Boto3: For connecting to AWS services and invoking Bedrock models
* Botocore: For handling AWS-specific errors

Functionality:
* Setup AWS Bedrock Client: Initializes the Bedrock client for invoking models.
* Define Prompt Data: Sets up the input prompt for generating an email.
* Invoke Model: Uses the Bedrock API to invoke the model and generate a response.
* Error Handling: Catches and handles specific AWS Client errors.
* Streaming Response: Demonstrates how to handle streaming responses from the model.
