AWS took all of that feedback from customers, and today we are excited to announce Amazon Bedrock, \
a new service that makes FMs from AI21 Labs, Anthropic, Stability AI, and Amazon accessible via an API. \
Bedrock is the easiest way for customers to build and scale generative AI-based applications using FMs, \
democratizing access for all builders. Bedrock will offer the ability to access a range of powerful FMs \
for text and images—including Amazons Titan FMs, which consist of two new LLMs we’re also announcing \
today—through a scalable, reliable, and secure AWS managed service. With Bedrock’s serverless experience, \
customers can easily find the right model for what they’re trying to get done, get started quickly, privately \
customize FMs with their own data, and easily integrate and deploy them into their applications using the AWS \
tools and capabilities they are familiar with, without having to manage any infrastructure (including integrations \
with Amazon SageMaker ML features like Experiments to test different models and Pipelines to manage their FMs at scale).
